You will need to optimize the transformation conditions and select the appropriate antibiotic resistance marker for selection of positive clones.\n|||Phase 3: Expression and Purification\nIn this phase, you will induce the expression of the equol-producing genes in E. coli and purify the equol protein. You will need to optimize the induction conditions and develop a purification protocol for the equol protein."

        "agent2_example1_AI":"||| Step 1: Plasmid Transformation\nStart by preparing competent E. coli cells, a strain that can uptake the recombinant plasmid DNA. You can use chemical methods like calcium chloride treatment or electroporation. Once prepared, mix the recombinant plasmid with the competent E. coli cells. If using the calcium chloride method, place the mix on ice, heat-shock at 42°C for approximately 90 seconds, then immediately cool on ice. If using electroporation, apply an electric field to permeabilize the cell membranes for DNA uptake.\n||| Step 2: Recovery and Plating\nAfter transformation, provide the cells a period of recovery by incubating them in a suitable nutrient medium without antibiotics, typically LB broth, for around an hour at 37°C. This allows the bacteria to express the antibiotic resistance gene present in the plasmid. Then, spread the transformed cells onto an agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic, corresponding to the resistance marker in the plasmid (e.g., ampicillin, kanamycin), and incubate overnight at 37°C.\n||| Step 3: Colony Screening\nThe next day, you should see discrete colonies on the agar plate. Each of these colonies originated from a single bacterium, and if the transformation was successful, they should all contain the recombinant plasmid. However, it's essential to confirm this. Isolate several colonies and grow them in a small volume of antibiotic-containing broth. After overnight growth, extract plasmid DNA from these cultures and verify the presence of your gene of interest using a technique such as restriction digestion analysis or sequencing. Successful colonies are called positive clones."

        "agent3_example1_human":"Preparation of Competent Cells: E. coli cells are first made 'competent' to uptake the plasmid. This is often done by treating the cells with a solution of calcium chloride, which increases the permeability of the cell membrane. Cells can also be made competent by electroporation, which uses an electric field to increase cell membrane permeability. In either case, the cells must be handled carefully and kept cold to maintain their competency.",
        "agent3_example1_AI":"||| Substep 1: Inoculate a flask of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with E.coli and grow the cells overnight at 37°C with shaking.\n||| Substep 2: Inoculate fresh LB broth with the overnight culture. The typical dilution is 1:100, but this might vary. Incubate the culture at 37°C with shaking until it reaches the log phase of growth (usually when the OD600nm = 0.4-0.6).\n||| Substep 3: Chill the flask on ice for at least 10 minutes. This slows down metabolism and prepares the cells for the cold temperatures used later in the protocol.\n||| Substep 4: Centrifuge the cells. This can be done at around 4000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.\n||| Substep 5: Resuspend the cells in a solution of ice-cold CaCl2 (typically around 100mM). It is important that the solution is ice-cold and the cells are kept on ice throughout the protocol.\n||| Substep 6: Incubate the cells on ice for about 20-30 minutes. This helps the cells to take up the CaCl2, making them more permeable to DNA.\n||| Substep 7: Centrifuge the cells again and then resuspend them in a smaller volume of ice-cold CaCl2 solution. This concentrates the cells, increasing the efficiency of transformation.\n||| Substep 8: Optionally, add glycerol to a final concentration of around 10% and freeze the cells at -80°C for future use."
